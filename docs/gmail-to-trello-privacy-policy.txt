### Software Downloads
The Chrome Web Store automatically generates anonymatized data regarding downloads of this extension. Once this extension is installed, it connects automatically to the Chrome Web Store to determine if updated versions are available, and generate anonymatized usage analytics using Google Analytics collection. All interactions with the Chrome Web Store, Google, and other third-parties are governed by their privacy policies.

### Bug Reports
You have the option to submit bug reports to us when an error occurs. If you choose to submit reports via the [Gmail-to-Trello Chrome Extension Trello site](https://trello.com/b/CGU9BYgd/gmail-to-trello-chrome-extension), the content of those reports will be available to the project developers and other customers, which may include third parties. We may disclose the information in the report to people as necessary to improve the software.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
We do not store personally identifiable information in the Chrome Extension, but any information collected from Gmail, shown via our UI, and then transferred to Trello via the Trello APIs is governed by Trello's Privacy Policy.

### Use of Information
In general, we use the information provided by you to make Gmail-to-Trello better.

### Disclosure of Your Information
We may be required to disclose information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

### Security
We do not store any information collected in any system besides the [Gmail-to-Trello Chrome Extension Trello site](https://trello.com/b/CGU9BYgd/gmail-to-trello-chrome-extension). Your Gmail and Trello accounts are owned by you and your responsibility. We cannot guarantee their security.
